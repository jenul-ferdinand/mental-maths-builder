# Mental Maths Builder


This computer application was made for a school project to help people build their mental math skills. GameMaker Studio 2 was the engine used to make this project. I chose to use this engine considering the limited amount of time I had to make this game for my school project.

Inspired by the game Cookie Clicker by Orteil, this takes a different approach. Instead of clicking cookies, you solve simple maths questions to earn marks which you can spend on upgrades to get more marks. 

The end goal is to have the most marks.
